# Incavery

Next gen and my final ray tracing engine, third generation (Planned)

## Too big...

My project and I have again gone down a dead-end path of development... so I will develop a C17 and C++20 library for the Vulkan API, which is much simpler than this original...

- [Tommy](https://github.com/helixd2s/Tommy) - new project of GPGPU compute, based on Vulkan API 1.2, for C++20 and C17...
